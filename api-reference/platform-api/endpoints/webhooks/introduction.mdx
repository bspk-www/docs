You can configure webhook endpoints via the API to be notified about events that happen in your BSPK Company.

A webhook enables BSPK to push real-time notifications to your app whenever an event happens in your account. Webhooks are particularly useful for asynchronous events like when a Sales Associate creates or updates a client. BSPK uses HTTPS to send these notifications to your app as a JSON payload. You can then use these notifications to execute actions in your backend systems.

Most users configure webhooks to sync their external systems’ data, like ERPs, to whenever some information changes at BSPK level.

### Steps to receive webhooks
You can start receiving event notifications in your app using the steps in this section:

1. Identify the events you want to monitor and the event payloads to parse.
2. Create a webhook endpoint as an HTTP endpoint (URL) on your local server (making sure it is publicly accessible).
3. Register your publicly accessible endpoint URL in the BSPK webook endpoint’s api.
4. Handle requests from BSPK by parsing each event object and returning 2xx response status codes.
5. Test that your webhook endpoint is working properly.
6. Deploy your webhook endpoint to production.
7. Replace your local server webhook endpoint with your Production endpoint.
