The BSPK Extraction API gives you access to your company’s BSPK data.

The BSPK Extraction API provides a RESTful interface with JSON-formatted responses to access many BSPK resources. The focus of this API is to give you the ability to extract data generated on BSPK’s side to your system.

There are many use cases you can use our API for, one common use case is to populate your analytics with data and events we generate here.

We are continuously working on expanding our API functionality, so stay tuned!
