At BSPK, security is a top priority. We employ advanced encryption methods, adhere to the latest industry standards, and partner with trusted, secure service providers. These measures work together to create a robust defense against potential threats, safeguarding your data while ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

### üîí Two Way Encryption 

Data transmitted between the BSPK platform via RESTful APIs is protected with end-to-end encryption, ensuring it remains secure and inaccessible to malicious actors. This encryption safeguards the confidentiality and integrity of the information during transit, preventing interception and unauthorized access.

### üè¢ Secure Service Providers 

To enhance the security of BSPK‚Äôs infrastructure, we have partnered with leading, globally recognized secure service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Salesforce-owned Heroku. These partnerships leverage state-of-the-art security measures, robust infrastructure, and comprehensive compliance certifications, ensuring a highly secure environment for our operations.

### üîê Two Factor Authentication 

We enhance the security of accessing BSPK systems by implementing two-factor authentication (2FA). This method requires users to provide two forms of verification: their password and a unique code generated by an authenticator app. This additional layer of security significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if a password is compromised.

### ‚úÖ Security Audit 

As part of BSPK‚Äôs commitment to robust security practices, we engaged KPMG, a globally recognized auditing firm, to conduct a comprehensive security audit for one of our client solutions. Any issues identified during the audit were meticulously addressed and resolved, ensuring full alignment with industry standards and reinforcing our dedication to maintaining a secure and reliable platform.

### üîè GDPR Compliant 

BSPK is committed to GDPR compliance, adhering to the European Union‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation. This ensures we protect the privacy and rights of individuals whose data we handle, demonstrating our dedication to responsible data management and respect for personal information.
